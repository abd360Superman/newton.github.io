            <p>Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian and philosipher. Newton has made the famous laws of Phsics. Unlike others in his day, he was much more curious. Once, an apple fell on his head from a tree. Usually, people would just forget about it. But Newton asked why. <em>Why did the apple fall on me?</em></p>
